I was looking for a place for internship and I left eyedesign website open. When I came back to it, the eye has already poplulate the entire webpage. I was fun and I thought of doing something fun like this with the project so I kept it as inspiration.

## Paragraph

Karen show us how to add array and call random individual character from the array of letters. We also look at how to put paragraph in, playing with leading. The array is what I end up using and struggling quite a lot in major project. But i didn't understand it quite well at the time so I use my mid semester break to study more about it. You can look at how I study array in the [next note](https://github.com/napasornc/c0dew0rd/tree/master/week%2006.2). We also look at how to erase letters by painting over it.
