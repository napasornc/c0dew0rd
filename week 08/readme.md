# Week 8 _ Refine Prototype :tired_face:

During this week I wasn't sure which prototype I should go with and didn't know where to start so I start going down github and youtube spiral. During the class, Karen, Andy, and a lot of my classmate share a lot of resources. I found that very useful, as someoone who just start coding, my only point of resource use to be p5.js web editor and youtube. Here is some resource I been using. 

1. openprocessing.org
2. timrodenbroeker.de
3. codepen
4. other people's github (classmate)

## What is needed for this prototype



## Class
This week we explore class which allow us to reduce the amount of code in your work. Class as I learn, group the object that have similar properties so we can trace back our code easier. To demonstrate this, Karen live code a wiggle letters.

Karen also show us the process of how to develop code from the existed code. From the wiggle letters, I suggest to the class that maybe we can work with sounds (I think) but it can be too complicate so Karen and the class extract the idea behind it and start working with easier way to code such as speed. We also look at how to split sentence into words.
