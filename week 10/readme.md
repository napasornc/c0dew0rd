# Week 10_WIP_Boid :thinking:

This was a rough week, I was very busy with placement and didn't have enough time to work on coding. Apart from that I was very stuck with the initial concept that I came up with, I realize that my idea is too difficult for me to code. I didn't have enough knowledge to excute my idea with the time that I have left so rethink everything. I went back to miro and start to look at all the parts of the reading I pulled out before, trying to figure out which part give me imagery that I can work with (visualizing). I choose to narrow down the reading to few sentences and start working on it, trying to simplify it as much as I can.

## Final decision

I arrive at the steering behavior: seek and flock. I start to explore boid behavior within flociking 

here is attempt number 2 (MajorProject4), 99% of the code are from daniel shiffman tutorial , so I will need to start adding my code in very soon.

During the week I have been coding more and focus on flocking
