## Week 3 _ Electronic-Literature :raised_eyebrow:

After looking at Avatar, identities in virtual space. We were introduced to few case studies, Mariko Mori stood out to me. The concept of cosplay is very familar to me since I attended cosplay events back at home. It is very interesting that avatar allow us to summerse ourself in virtual world, becoming our extending self, which ultimately can be our alter ego. There is a sense of anonymity. 

### Mariko Mori

[Mariko](http://www.marthagarzon.com/contemporary_art/2011/08/mariko-mori-cybergeishas-technonolgy/) appears costumed as a sexy cyborg, pop star, mermaid, futuristic goddess. Her performance put her avatart in the real world. Reversing the concept of having 'you' in virtual world. Wokring with imagaination, building surreal imagery.

### Sonic Pi

[Live coding Music Synth](https://youtu.be/KJPdbp1An2s) code by Sam Aaron using Sonic Pi is very mind boggling, it was verying impressive to see code in action in real time. In his [TedTalks](https://youtu.be/TK1mBqKvIyU), he said that his purpose for doing live performance is to "lower the barrier to creative experience with code". Segway into "desinger who can't code is like chef who can't cook", which I think having backend/process as a focal point make coding less intimidating.
> thank you Andy and Karen for this beautiful code
