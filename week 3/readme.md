## Week 3 _ Electronic-Literature :raised_eyebrow:

After looking at Avatar, identities in virtual space. We were introduced to few case studies, Mariko Mori stood out to me. The concept of cosplay is very familar to me since I attended cosplay events back at home. It is very interesting that avatar allow us to summerse ourself in virtual world, becoming our extending self, which ultimately can be our alter ego. There is a sense of anonymity. 

### Mariko Mori

[Mariko](http://www.marthagarzon.com/contemporary_art/2011/08/mariko-mori-cybergeishas-technonolgy/) appears costumed as a sexy cyborg, pop star, mermaid, futuristic goddess. Her performance put her avatart in the real world. Reversing the concept of having 'you' in virtual world. Wokring with imagaination, building surreal imagery.
