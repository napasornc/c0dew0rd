# Show and tell :scream:

In the beginning of the class we refelct back to what we learnt in the past six weeks which then transition nicely into our chosen text. We went and filled the  sheet with 50 - 100 words pulling from our text. What I found really interesting is some people describ their reson as 

## Showing paper prototype 
I was fairly stuck: With smaller group of my classmates telling their : showing paper prototype 

problem = paper protottype
solution = how to translating that into code

## The critical code
coder's comment
working with pretend data
anti climate change took it as an evidence that climate change isn't real. is code worth study as a literary source: syntex and grammar: how code is written.

protest sign written in computer code: political messege. 
example of pho code: non excecutable code

> Live pho code by Karen

technological ephurisim: computer/code will fix all problem, utopia - more technology = better life. 

psudeo code: non excecutable code

## P5.js Play

sprite sheet: stick figure will have to use in order to run

sprite = a collection of img that is animate, get in held in one img. as asset thaT you can bring into a sketch and make animation: pixels-based images in grid

addtional library: need to tell the sketch - include this new thing. this library translate java to p5.js

sprite can be made from words/letter: anything you can draw

JAVA 
p5.js - another language of java : can publish/edit on web
ps play - extented library of p5.js. Tested and workso you can use as a skeleton - can't copy this code to the sketch, need to download the extended library

thesis and the systhesis: text has two side.

identify what kind of function/outcome you are looking for: can find what simlilar - then apply to text

how would you appraoch taking code from the web: if everyone what to hide their code, we wpn't be here. give them credit too tho
