# Week One > What is CodeWord

We first got a warm introduct from Andy and Karen, explaining what is Code+Word. As someone who is so new to coding, their view on translating conventional type on paper,which is what I am used to, onto digital world is very intriguing. I did a bit of research before class and found The Library of Nonhuman Books. At first I couldn't comprehen how machine can entirely create a book. In my head, text is carefully crafted while code is generated by machine, more mechanical. Code to me is an alien language so it's very natural to assume that everything we read was produce by Human but I guess not anymore. I couldn't in a million year doubt any text written by machine, it's so human-like. Give me goosebump.
