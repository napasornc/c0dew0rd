# Week 9_WIP_Voice recognition :dizzy_face:
I have start to follow tutorial on how to work with voice recognition because I would like to use environmental noise to generate text. But after chating with others in class today. I'm going to try another idea which is using camera tracking but I haven't try that yet. I'll pose work in progress late

motion tracking isn't working yet, [poseNet_part_selection](https://editor.p5js.org/ml5/sketches/FkBtHfKP0i) is the reference I'm looking at.
