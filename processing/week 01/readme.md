# Here is all the code from week 1
From week one, I didn't know how to code, never heard of p5.js or github. I did a little bit of python in high school as a compulsory class but it's not really coding becuase I was so confuse. At the end I just gave up. I know this class is going to be challanging but I think it's a very good class to expand myself to other area of design.
