# Here is all the code from week 2
This week I have fun trying out different things in the sketch. I did bunch of small sketches that has nothing to do with making letter but it was great to learn what can be done with processing. I found generative text code with java script, it was intersting but didn't know at the time that you can convert java to p5.js
