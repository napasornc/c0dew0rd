# Here is all the code from week 6.2
This week I spend time more on reaerching and interpretating the reading but I want to do a little bit of coding to keep the flow going. You can't play tic-tac-toe with this attempt but I was able to create grid and learn about array. I used Jamie's work as a case study, broke down his code and learn different part of hos code. It was helpful but it didn't get anything running.    

## What fail
1. Tic-Tac-Toe
