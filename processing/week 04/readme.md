# Here is all the code from week 4
The spinning text is very interesting. Learning how to add motion is something I always facinated with, I discovered gernative modular type before the class from Typographics conference but I didn't know how to start. I think at 
this point I start to have self-doubt and worry that coding might be too big of a project for me but I still have 
fun and enjpy the process of not knowing if this code is the right tools for excuting what I have in mind. I don't really know how to bring design into this except from changing color and text and shape. I was struggling to figure out how to get the right coordinates so I can form the composition.
