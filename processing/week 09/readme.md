# Here is all the code from week 9

## What work
see Dinner Party in action [here]

## What fail
These two code isn't functioning so there is no link to live work. 
1. Dinner
2. Motion Detection

However, with the motion detection, I was able to get the library working which is a huge win because I spend so much time trying to import it. I was able to get the video working but not the pose net.
