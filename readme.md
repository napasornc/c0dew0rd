# Statement

This work is more artistic than any other work that I do. Hypertext is new to me. I think typography plays part in this project, coming from a little bit of an experimental typographer help with the project.

# Final word
I would like to write a tiny section of a reflection. After processing what I learn through out his class, I have come to conclusion that I need more time going through the concept of e-literature, and get more familar with coding language. I first join this class because I was wondering how publication and how our language tranform from 2D to digital space. I love books and post-digital is the future of reading. I always facinated by creative code + environmental deisng + experience design. Starting from the light festival in Sydney but it didn't know how to start that why I wanted to learn how designer can be coder. I think I learn a lot about coding and will continue to code after my year in uni. In my opinion, not only I see how typogrpahy perform as an interactive piece of art, I was introduce to AI, AR, 3D model, 3D space, java, html, css. All of these are not something I expect to learn from uni but it was the best decision to take this class. I'm now learning more about AR even though I will need to work on coding and spend more time on it, this is a great experience and pack of resource. Sorry for jumping back anf ford, just thought it's my last SKO so I want to leave a little reflective piece.
